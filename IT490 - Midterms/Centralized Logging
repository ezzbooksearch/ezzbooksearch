Centralized Logging
----------------------

Centralized Logging is achieved by 2 methods:

- a single php. file embedded in every VM that logs-in errors when an error is triggered and appends to a txt. file

- a true centralized logging vm - that logs and monitors every activity by any user with the following options:
              * Server is linked and outputs to a mysql db
              * Server has a functional web-based UI that can display real-time log events
              * Server detects server/web-based/user errors 
              * Server can output scv/txt/html files
              
              
INSTRUCTIONS (Terminal-based)
--------------------
INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
--------------------
1. Apache
Install Apache Web server 

2. MySQL
Install MySQL database

3. PHP
Install php

4. Restart Web Server

5. Rsyslog (different versions will install to different directories - TAKE NOTE)
Install Rsyslog
---------------------------------------------------
LINK MYSQL DB to RSYSLOG (from syslog to rsyslogdb)
---------------------------------------------------
1. Create DB rsyslog and table columns (Date, Host, Event, Message, etc..)
2. Create dedicated user acces to RsyslogDB
3. Configure the Rsyslog server in order to use MySQL

      *vi /etc/rsyslog.conf as root: (YOU NEED TO EDIT THIS)
      
Add the MySQL module:

$ModLoad ommysql

Add the forwarding rule:

*.* :ommysql:127.0.0.1,rsyslogdb,rsysloguser,changeMe  ( *Credentials set in step 1 MUST MATCH to those in step 2) 

where:

127.0.0.1 -       mysql server address (THIS CHANGES - read below)
rsyslogdb -       mysql rsyslog database name
rsysloguser -     mysql rsyslog database user username
changeMe -        mysql rsyslog database user password
        
      *IMPORTANT - the IP address will change depending on the network the Server is using
      *Credentials set in step 1 MUST MATCH to those in step 2 (AGAIN!!)
      
4. RESTART rsyslog, mysql, apache for the logger to take effect and start log-in information

5. You will start seeing that your data fields in mysql DB being populated by log entries afterwards
